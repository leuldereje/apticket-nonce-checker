This script parses 32-bit APTicket .der files and .shsh files and prints the nonce inside of the ticket.

Compatible with macOS and Linux. openssl is required, but should be installed by default.

Your APTickets should be good for the iOS 9.x restore bug (32-bit only) if they do not have a nonce.

Example:

$ ./apticket-nonce-checker.py iPhone5_8.3-12F70.shsh 
Parsing APTicket from SHSH file.
APTicket has a nonce.
Nonce (hex dump): eabcfa378d0dbca8c26d1c25de56928cd85ba06a
Nonce length:     20 bytes

$ ./apticket-nonce-checker.py iPhone5_9.3.5-13G36.shsh
Parsing APTicket from SHSH file.
APTicket does not have a nonce.
